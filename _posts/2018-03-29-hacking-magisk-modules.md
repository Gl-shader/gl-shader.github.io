## MagiskHide Props Config
Even on a rooted Android phones, you won't be able to debug your apps if they are built as non-debuggable. In order to work around that, you need to somehow change the `ro.debuggable` attribute to 1. However, if you do that, an app can read `/default.prop` to detect that and stop operating. The solution is to use Magisk and its module called `MagiskHide Props Config`. More info on `MagiskHide Props Config` can be found at https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-simple-t3765199

### Installation
Install through the Magisk Manager Downloads section.

### Usage
After installing and rebooting:
```
su
props
```
Then, choose `MagiskHide props` to change `ro.debuggable` to 1

## Magisk SELinux manager
Some tools and apps (e.g. frida, EDS, Viper Acoustic, ...) do not work if SELinux is en enforcing mode. `Magisk SELinux manager` allows changing SELinux mode while being undetected by SafetyNet.

### Installation
Install through the Magisk Manager Downloads section.

## Systemless Xposed Framework
This allows SafetyNet-undetectable installation of Xposed Framework.

### Installation
Install through the Magisk Manager Downloads section.
